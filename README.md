Object Detection Models
This repository contains three object detection models implemented using the Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLOv2 algorithms. The models were developed as part of a university coursework on computer vision and deep learning and aided in the writing of a research paper on .
"A Deep Learning Study: Comparing Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLOv2 for Human Detection in CCTV Surveillance Systems"

About the Models
The models are trained to detect people in CCTV images.

Repository Structure
The repository has the following structure:

FASTER_RCNN: Contains the Faster R-CNN model implementation.
FINALSSD: Contains the SSD model implementation.
FINALYOLOv2: Contains the YOLOv2 model implementation.
data: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
